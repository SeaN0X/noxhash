# noxhash
a simple hashing algorythm to hash stuff i guess.

# support
as it uses bytes, i think it supports any type of character input and length

# conclusion

i don't have any idea if it's unsafe or something, but as almost no one have it's source, i'll use this hash algorythm on my databases.
if no one have the logic to compute your hash, no one can guess it.
